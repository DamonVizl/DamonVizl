### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Damon Vizl, I am an Electrical Engineer (15 years RAN), Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Engineer (Post Grad, Deakin University), Software Developer (C#, Python, some others), and a maker. 
I am open to new job opportunities in AI and ML. 

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
I have just completed post graduate studies in AI at Deakin and am currently learning how to utilise Hugging Face and OpenAI APIs and models to supplement my programs. 
  
## âš¡ Projects âš¡
Here are some projects you can check out to see how I work.
## AI/ML Demos 
### Object Detection and Tracking 
I created an object detection and tracking program that can track emergency services vehicles (fire appliances, ambulances and police vehicles).

### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
I have also worked on many supervised and unsupervised learning machine learning models for data analysis, trend analysis, prediction and forecasting. Specifically Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVC, Ensemble methods including RFC and many more. 
  
## Software Dev
### Hammer and Tongs
[Hammer and Tongs](https://lemonlimebitta.itch.io/hammer-and-tongs) - A small indie developed game I built for a game jam. Mine, craft and sell items to upgrade your gear!

### AI DM 
An Artificial Intelligence Dungeon Master that leverages the OpenAI API to DM a table top RPG adventure. Use any setting (fantasy, sci-fi, cyberpunk, modern war, high school, you name it!) and create your own party to go on ever changing and adapting adventures.

## Maker Projects
### Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
Autonomous depth stabilisation. Created for my honours project for my degree in 2012 (pre AI) using control theory systems. Find the summary report [here](SummaryReport.pdf).\

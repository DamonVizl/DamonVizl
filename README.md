### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Damon Vizl, I have worked as an Electrical Engineer for 11 years and as a Firefighter for 4 years! I am now studying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Deakin University to become an AI/ML Developer/Engineer!

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
During my studies I have built classification and detection AI systems, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, AI API integration, and more. 

  
## AI/ML Demos 
### Object Detection and Tracking 
I created an object detection and tracking program that can track emergency services vehicles (fire appliances, ambulances and police vehicles).

## âš¡ Projects âš¡
Here are some projects you can check out to see how I work

### Hammer and Tongs
[Hammer and Tongs](https://github.com/DamonVizl/Hammer-And-Tongs) - A small indie developed game I built for a game jam. Mine, craft and sell items to upgrade your gear!
### AI DM 
An Artificial Intelligence Dungeon Master that leverages the OpenAI API to DM a table top RPG adventure. Use any setting (fantasy, sci-fi, cyberpunk, modern war, high school, you name it!) and create your own party to go on ever changing and adapting adventures.

### Hi there 👋
My name is Damon Vizl, I am an Electrical Engineer (15 years RAN), Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Engineer (Post Grad, Deakin University), Game Developer (C#, Python, some others), and a maker. 

## 🌱 Working On 🌱
I am currently solo developing Descend, deep in production hoping to show it to the world soon with a public demo this year! 
  
## ⚡ Projects ⚡
Here are some projects you can check out to see how I work.
  
## Game Dev
### Descend (Title Pending)
[Descend](https://lemonlimebitta.itch.io/drogue) - In development Roguelite ARPG. Go down multiple levels with random skills, augments and gear and create a new build every run.

### Hammer and Tongs
[Hammer and Tongs](https://lemonlimebitta.itch.io/hammer-and-tongs) - A small indie developed game I built for a game jam. Mine, craft and sell items to upgrade your gear!

### AI DM 
An Artificial Intelligence Dungeon Master that leverages the OpenAI API to DM a table top RPG adventure. Use any setting (fantasy, sci-fi, cyberpunk, modern war, high school, you name it!) and create your own party to go on ever changing and adapting adventures.

### Packing
[Packing](https://jowei.itch.io/packing) - Worked in a group of 5 to create this 2D game about moving. Quickly pack all the items but take care not to break anything!

## AI/ML 
### Object Detection and Tracking 
I created an object detection and tracking program that can track emergency services vehicles (fire appliances, ambulances and police vehicles).

### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
I have also worked on many supervised and unsupervised learning machine learning models for data analysis, trend analysis, prediction and forecasting. Specifically Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVC, Ensemble methods including RFC and many more. 

### Acoustic Analysis with the RAN
Through 2023 I worked under the AUKUS initiative in a team developing Acoustic Analysis techniques. Contact me for further information. 
 
## Maker Projects
### Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
Autonomous depth stabilisation. Created for my honours project for my degree in 2012 (pre AI) using control theory systems. Find the summary report [here](SummaryReport.pdf).\

My name is Damon Vizl, I have worked as an Electrical Engineer for 11 years and as a Firefighter for 4 years! I am now studying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Deakin University to become an AI/ML Developer/Engineer!

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
During my studies I have built classification and detection AI systems, Computer Vision, and more. 

## âš¡ Projects âš¡
Here are some projects you can check out to see how I work
